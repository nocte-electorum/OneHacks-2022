## How To Build:

**Ensure you have Rust and Node.JS installed.**

In the project directory, run:
```
npm install
```
to install all the dependencies. It might take a minute.

Then, run:
```
npm run tauri:serve
```
and wait for the build process to finish.  It can take several minutes for the first compile, but much less for every subsequent compile.
